Task 5 
Group 3


Processes and user interface

The task is done by a group of 5 people. Communication, planning, delegation of tasks and github branches are the most important part of the project. 
The group is given access to a finished prototype, given by a designer. 
Variables will help the group end up at a similar looking design, even when working seperately. 
From start to finish, the group is working around a sprint log, that instructs tasks that needs to be finished by the end of the week. One sprint is from monday - friday. Giving us a total of two sprints.
Also a backlog is created for a full overview of what needs to be done before launching the website.
The finished product is published through Netlify, and viewd by designer Febuary 2nd.
